# Practical

Today is more than about following a step by step process to complete some task. We will require you to understand how to utilise third party components.

- Using NPM set up your project and install `vue`

- To start with, take a contact form from [w3fools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp) and implement it 
  as a vue component

- Next, I would like you to add validation using a component like [Vee Validate](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate)

 - If you're feeling adventurous you can explore  [the Curated list of view components](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#menu) and find some that could be used in your assignment 

 
 - If you're feeling really adventurous! You can look at installing the [https://github.com/vuejs/vuefire](https://github.com/vuejs/vuefire) component and store contact details is a Firebase Real Time database. If you do this and included it in your assignment you'll gain a lot of browny points!
